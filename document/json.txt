It is Javascript object notation

The difference is the keys should be enclosed in double quotes

Key can be anything and value also can take any values

Every JSON is valid Javascript Object but not vice versa

JSON object can only be accessed as a["name"] only we cannot do a.name

JSON operations are shows in ./data.js
