We divide the content on a page into different smaller components for easy of use and maintainability

A component contains function which returns JSX to us and we require it at the place where we want that to be

The name of the component should be capital first letter always because all html tags are small letter

dividing websites we create small components as header footer main body etc

Then we can combine these components into one

The whole component should be enclosed in div tag

A component can be combination of multiple react elements put together

Every component should be put in separate folder because every component has at least 2 files as .js and .css

It's recommended to make the file name and folder name capital as components should be capital

In every component file the first line import React from 'react'; is necessary

Then we have to create a function may be array function the name should be capital letter first

Then inside the function create a variable the return it at the end of function

At last export that function so that we can import this component into
