We divide the content on a page into different smaller components for ease of use and maintainability

A component contains a function which returns JSX

The name of the component should always have its first letter capitalized to differ from standard HTML tags, which are always lowercase

Websites can be divided into small components like header, footer, main, body, etc. and those can be combined into a single reusable React component

The whole component should be enclosed into a tag. A <div> is commonly used to do so.

A component can contain a combination of multiple react components

Since it is common for a component to have two files (.js and .css), it is suggested that those files are stored in a separate folder

It's recommended to name the file and folder with their first letter capitalized, following the same convention as the name of the function component

In every component file the first line "import React from 'react';" is necessary

At last, always remember to export the function so that it can be imported into another file / component
