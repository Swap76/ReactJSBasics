When we have to make multiple objects of same component then we can use map function this is a function of array

It is written as a.map( (value )=> {
 // here we can write the desired code
})

const b = a.map((value) => { // Example this creates a array of squares using a
  return value*value;
});

This type of programming is called as functional programming in such we don't care about what under the hood happens we are only concerned with the output and input

Examples are shown in test.js
