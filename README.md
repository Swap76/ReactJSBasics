## Created using create-react-app

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:
```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
```
No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
```
cd my-app
```
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
